We love WordPress SEO by Yoast, but we've gotten tired of being thrown to their welcome page any time we do a batch of updates. This plugin removes that redirect. 

== Description ==

WordPress SEO by Yoast has an action hooked to 'admin_init' that redirects to their about page. This is annoying, especially when you have updated other plugins, themes or WordPress core at the same time. It is essentially hijacking your workflow. This simple plugin (with no UI) removes the hooked action so that the redirect does not take place.

Credits: Kevin Miller wrote the function; Donna McMaster turned it into a plugin. Thanks also to Mark Jaquith for the inspiration provided by Menu Humility. 

== Installation ==

1. It should just work when you activate it.
